## Cacophony (WIP)

Cacophony is a work-in-progress Metroidvania game inspired by Hollow Knight, built using Godot Engine. I am currently in the very very early stages of development and exploring various mechanics, art styles, and ideas, but please keep in mind: I have no clue what I am doing! It will be based on a magic system I have been developing for my books, and it may take part in the same timeline.


# About

In Cacophony, you will explore a mysterious, chaotic world full of dark corners, powerful enemies, and hidden secrets. The game focuses on platforming, exploration, and combat, with the eventual goal of creating a vast interconnected world inspired by the Metroidvania genre.


# Roadmap

- [ ] Basic player movement
- [ ] Basic enemies and combat
- [ ] Expand world map
- [ ] Add upgrades and abilities
- [ ] Boss fights and final world design
- [ ] Sound and music design (ideally not a cacophony...)
- [ ] Polish and optimize the game

# How to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siucrae/cacophony.git
```

Open the project in Godot Engine.
Run the scene and explore the early prototype of the game!
